# Security policy

Tau is early-stage software, but security issues are important. Please report suspected vulnerabilities through GitHub private vulnerability reporting for `dpc/tau` (<https://github.com/dpc/tau/security/advisories/new>) when available. If that path is unavailable, contact the maintainer privately first and avoid filing a public issue with exploit details.

For technical trust boundaries, start with [ARCH-external-message-boundary](specs/ARCH-external-message-boundary.md) and the applicable project and component records under `specs/` and `crates/*/specs/`.
Authenticated ChatGPT quota acquisition and its credential-free lifecycle are
documented in
[`tau-provider-chatgpt/SECURITY.md`](crates/tau-provider-chatgpt/SECURITY.md)
and
[`tau-ext-provider-builtin/SECURITY.md`](crates/tau-ext-provider-builtin/SECURITY.md).

Peer harness messaging is cooperative same-UID local IPC, not a hostile-process
sandbox or per-sender ACL. Callback correlation prevents accidental sender/route
confusion before bounded admission or model-spending auto-start, while peer text
remains model input rather than a harness instruction. Delivery is best-effort
at-least-once: an ambiguous crash or retry can duplicate prompts, agents, model
work, and spend.

## Local IPC and external ingress

Configured extension processes are trusted local executables. “Less-trusted
extension” means protocol authority is limited—the harness still validates phase,
source ownership, routing identity, configuration, and collisions—not that the
stdio stream is a hostile availability boundary or process sandbox. Operation
quotas do not promise to bound protocol deserialization; see
[`SPEC-tau-harness-session-state`](crates/tau-harness/specs/SPEC-tau-harness-session-state.md#extension-data)
and [`ARCH-tau-supervisor`](crates/tau-supervisor/specs/ARCH-tau-supervisor.md#child-environment).
Robust framing and cleanup improvements are welcome when scoped, but unrelated
features must not be expanded into slowloris, connection-flood, or sandbox
hardening without an approved threat-model design.

Inter-harness/session communication is likewise cooperative same-UID IPC, with
correlation and bounded model-spend admission rather than hostile-sender ACLs.
Genuinely untrusted ingress is external network/service content received through
Slack, XMPP, Telegram, providers, web fetches, and similar adapters. Authenticate
and bound that adapter boundary where applicable and keep payloads untrusted model
content; proxying them through an extension does not make the local extension
transport itself adversarial. The boundary summary is recorded in
[`ARCH-external-message-boundary`](specs/ARCH-external-message-boundary.md).

## Standalone compaction recovery reliability

Standalone compaction and its continuation are harness-owned durable work. Every
new provider cut must be a closed transcript prefix; a tool-calling assistant
response and its complete terminal results node are indivisible. A failed
transaction with a resume watermark remains fail-closed until an explicit
successor preserves same-branch coverage of that watermark. A successor may
retreat its cut to retain more exact suffix, but it must not replace the owed
watermark with an ancestor or sibling selected by later head navigation.
Ordinary input and `/cancel` do not abandon this ownership; if the selected head
no longer descends from the owed watermark, explicit recovery must remain
blocked. Core validation and warm/cold replay regressions enforce these rules.
Revisit them when adding any explicit abandon/rewind operation or changing
compaction replay ownership.

## Reporting guidance

When reporting a vulnerability, include:

- affected Tau version or commit;
- operating system and relevant configuration;
- minimal reproduction steps;
- whether an extension, provider, UI client, or daemon boundary is involved;
- any logs that do not contain secrets.

Avoid sharing API keys, OAuth tokens, email contents, or other private data in
reports.
